## TL;DR

Prepare your Ubuntu terminal dev environment with one command (well, sort of). Become terminal power-user in no time.

Install, configure and maintain Ubuntu 24.04/22.04 terminal environment focused on development and administration. This includes installation/configuration of very useful dev tools and customizations to ease out and speed up terminal usage during day-to-day work and to bump up productivity.

Below project is supported on Ubuntu running on Windows WSL2, but it is also tested on Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 images.
