There are couple of useful plugins installed there (you can find them in `ansible/roles/config/templates/zshrc.j2`), which provide for example:

- syntax highlighting
- commands autocompletion (based on history and/or completion scripts)
- [FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) integration (command history search, directory search, integration with `fd`)
- fuzzy search/go to directory
- aliases autosuggestions - tells you that you have an alias for particular commands
- easily traversing through **visited** directories (using [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide))
- correct your commands automatically with [pay-respects](https://github.com/iffse/pay-respects)
- finding files with FZF
- Windows clipboard support - also works from VIM (copying in VIM makes it available in Windows clipboard)
