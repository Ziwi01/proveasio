In `ansible/roles/software/vars/main.yml` file, you can find everything that can be configured in terms of software. See [Configuration customizations](../../category/customizations) for details.

To disable installation of anything, you can add an array in your overrides file, for example:

```
software_tasks_exclude:

  - keychain
```
